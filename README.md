✈️ C++ Air Ticket Booking System

This project is a console-based simulation of a basic international flight booking platform, developed to demonstrate core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in C++.

It models the entire user journey from destination selection through flight choice, itinerary display, and final price calculation, including mandatory taxes and service fees.

✨ Features

OOP Design: Implements clear separation of concerns using the Flight class (encapsulating price, time, and transit data) and the BookingSystem class (handling the logic, calculations, and user flow).

Mandatory Price Calculation: Automatically calculates the final ticket price by applying a 10% tax and a 6% service fee to the base price.

Transit Flight Logic: Dynamically generates itineraries for five international destinations, specifying transit stops (Dubai, Kuala Lumpur) or direct flights.

Dubai Transit: Used for flights to New York and UK.

Kuala Lumpur (KL) Transit: Used for flights to Sydney and Singapore.

Direct: Used for flights to China.

Structured Data: Pre-loads five distinct flight options for each destination, allowing the user to select by flight ID.

Robust User Interface: Utilizes clear console output and basic input validation for a smooth booking experience.
